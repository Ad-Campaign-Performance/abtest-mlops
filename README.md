## Introduction

As a Machine learning engineer, our tasks is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.

## Overview

- Learning Outcomes
  > Statistical Modelling

> Using core data science python libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

> ML algorithms Logistic regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost

> Model management (building ML catalog contains model feature labels and training model version)

> MLOps with DVC, CML, and MLFlow

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/Ad-Campaign-Performance/abtest-mlops.git
cd abtest-mlops
pip install -r requirements.txt
